## About

> Iâ€™m a first-year graduate student. I major in software engineering and I got a bachelor's degree in computer science in Wuhan University, China. 

In my spare time, I enjoy learning new techniques and building interesting software. I also used to record my learning experience in my [`blog`](http://118.178.94.244/).
