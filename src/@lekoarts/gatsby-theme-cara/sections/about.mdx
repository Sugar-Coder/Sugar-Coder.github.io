## About

> I’m an undergraduate student in my fourth year of college. I major in Computer Science in Wuhan University, China. Next year, I’m going to study for Master’s degree in Software Engineering. 

In my spare time, I enjoy learning new techniques and building interesting software. I also used to record my learning experience in my [`blog`](http://118.178.94.244/).

The Games I've played: [CF](https://cf.qq.com/), [CR](https://cr.qq.com/), [PUBG](https://www.pubgmobile.com/home.shtml), [QQ Speed](https://speed.qq.com/), [Fall Guys](https://fallguys.com/).
