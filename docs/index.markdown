## 这是我的个人主页，还在搭建之中...

> The webside is just getting start😄. You can visit my [Blog](http://118.178.94.244/)(Chinese) to explore something interesting.

Hi! I'm an undergraduate student in my fourth year of college. I major in Computer Science in WuHan University. Next year, I'm going to study for Master's degree in Software Engineering. In my spare time, I love learning new technique and building interesting softwares. I also used to record my learning experience in my blogs.
My plan is to make this website a place that presenting more about me. Therefore, I'm struggling expanding my the frontend knowledge these days🤣.

```java
public class Sugar{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("I love playing basketball and software building");
    System.out.println("All comments are well appreciated in my blog");
  }
}
```
